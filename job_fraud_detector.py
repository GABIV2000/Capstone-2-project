        Welcome to the **AI-Powered Job Fraud Detector** üë©‚ÄçüíªüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

        This tool was developed by a group of students as part of an academic project. Our goal is to help job seekers quickly and safely evaluate job listings using the power of AI.

        ### üéØ What This Tool Does:
        - Analyzes job listings using Google's Gemini AI
        - Flags suspicious language, unrealistic offers, or scam indicators
        - Provides a verdict with a confidence score and explanation

        We built this platform to raise awareness about online job scams, which are becoming increasingly common ‚Äî especially among students and early-career professionals.

        ### üß† Built By Students, For Students
